1. Utilized YOLO v8, a deep learning object detection model, to detect and localize vehicle  
license plates within images or video streams captured in traffic environments.
2. Integrated EasyOCR for optical character recognition (OCR), enabling the  
extraction and interpretation of alphanumeric characters from detected license  
plates. 
3. Developed a Python-based project for seamless integration of YOLO v8 and EasyOCR,  
providing a user-friendly interface for real-time or batch processing of vehicle number  
plates in traffic situations.
