# Automatic License Plate Recognition System

This project employs YOLO v8, a deep learning object detection model, to accurately detect and pinpoint license plates on vehicles within images or live video feeds captured in traffic scenarios. Additionally, EasyOCR is integrated for optical character recognition (OCR), facilitating the extraction and interpretation of alphanumeric characters from the identified license plates.

The system is implemented using Python and provides a seamless integration of YOLO v8 and EasyOCR, offering a user-friendly interface for real-time processing or batch processing of vehicle license plates in various traffic situations.
